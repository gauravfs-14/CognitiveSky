      question: "What is CognitiveSky?",
      answer:
        "CognitiveSky is a research-grade dashboard for visualizing, analyzing, and exploring mental health narratives on the Bluesky platform. It ingests public posts in real time via the Firehose API, processes them through a robust NLP pipeline, and generates insights into sentiment, emotion, topic trends, and user behavior. The dashboard enables both high-level overview and deep narrative investigation, making it suitable for researchers, policymakers, and mental health professionals.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is the data collected?",
      answer:
        "Posts are collected from Blueskyâ€™s public Firehose stream 24/7 and filtered using mental health-related keyword matching. The data is stored in Supabase as the initial ingestion layer. A labeling pipeline classifies each post with sentiment and emotion labels using transformer-based models, and assigns semantic topics using topic modeling techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and NMF. Labeled data is migrated to a local-first SQLite-compatible Turso database optimized for analysis.",
    },
    {
      question: "How frequently is the data updated?",
      answer:
        "Data ingestion runs continuously, while NLP labeling, topic modeling, and summary generation are executed daily via a GitHub Actions workflow. This ensures that the dashboard reflects both near-real-time content and daily narrative shifts. Summaries such as volume trends, emotional distributions, and top hashtags/emojis are recalculated each midnight UTC and stored as JSON files.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the sentiment labels and how are they determined?",
      answer:
        "Sentiment labels include Positive, Neutral, and Negative. These are inferred using the CardiffNLP RoBERTa sentiment model, which is fine-tuned for short social text. Positive reflects encouraging or hopeful tones, Neutral includes factual or objective posts, and Negative captures distressed, critical, or harmful expressions. These labels are further correlated with emoji and hashtag usage in the dashboard.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is emotion detection handled?",
      answer:
        "Emotions are classified using the 'j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base' transformer model, which supports fine-grained categories such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and love. Each post is tagged with the most probable emotion, and distributions are tracked over time and by topic.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are topics generated?",
      answer:
        "Topics are derived using an unsupervised machine learning approach. Posts are vectorized using TF-IDF, and NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) is used to extract latent topics. Each topic includes top keywords and is tracked for daily volume, sentiment, emotion, and associated hashtags/emojis. This allows exploration of emerging mental health narratives.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does the Word Cloud show?",
      answer:
        "The Word Cloud visualizes the most frequent hashtags or emojis used in mental health-related posts, either globally or per sentiment/emotion/topic filter. It updates daily based on a 7-day rolling window, helping identify trending symbols and expressions within mental health discourse.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is historical data handled?",
      answer:
        "All labeled posts are stored in Turso, allowing for full historical analysis. Snapshots of summary statistics are computed and saved per day. The dashboard visualizes both total aggregate statistics (e.g., total posts, most used hashtags) and time series for the past 7 days. Older data is not discarded and can be queried programmatically if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What infrastructure powers CognitiveSky?",
      answer:
        "CognitiveSky runs a modular architecture: ingestion via a Node.js-based Firehose listener, storage in Supabase, labeling with Python + HuggingFace models, and a summary generator script using scikit-learn and libsql for Turso. All components are orchestrated with GitHub Actions and environment-configured pipelines for minimal overhead and open reproducibility.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this data for research or policy work?",
      answer:
        "Yes. All analyses are based on publicly available posts and adhere to ethical considerations. The dashboard supports open exploration for academic, social, and healthcare research, and can be extended to custom queries and comparative studies. Daily JSON summaries are version-controlled and publicly exportable for transparency.",
